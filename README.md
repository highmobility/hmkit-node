# HMKit Node.js SDK

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/hmkit.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hmkit)

The HMKit Node.js SDK makes it easy to work with car data using the _HIGH MOBILITY API_ platform. The SDK implements a strong security layer between your Node.js app and the platform while giving you straightforward native interface to read and write to connected cars.

The library is designed to give Node.js developers simple access to High Mobility's systems, by handling all the communication protocols, authentication flows and other security related components.

## Requirements

HMKit Node.js SDK requires node v7.6.0 or higher for ES2015 and async function support.

## Integration

Use the npm package manager for Node.js. Simply type the following into a terminal window:

```
$ npm install hmkit
```

## Getting started

Get started by reading the [Node.js SDK guide](https://high-mobility.com/learn/tutorials/sdk/node-js/) in high-mobility.com.  
Check out the [code references](https://high-mobility.com/learn/documentation/cloud-sdks/node-js/commands/) for more details than present in code documentation.

### Examples

There are 2 sample apps available on Github.com to showcase different use-cases for HMKit:

* [Scaffold](https://github.com/highmobility/hm-node-scaffold)
  * Demonstrates the most basic implementation to use HMKit.
* [AutoAPI Explorer](https://github.com/highmobility/hm-node-auto-api-explorer)
  * This project should give you an overview of how to implement [High Mobility's](https://www.high-mobility.com/) OAuth and the HMKit Node.js SDK for working with car data. It consists of two pages: a login page to start the authentication flow, and a dashboard which displays the car's diagnostics state and lets you toggle the door locks.
