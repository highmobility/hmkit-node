# Introduction

We would love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. Before getting to work, please first discuss the changes that you wish to make with us via GitHub Issues, [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/high-mobility/) or [Slack](https://slack.high-mobility.com/).

# Pull Request Process

We strive to ensure high quality across all our projects. In order to achieve this, we require that all pull requests meet these expectations:

1. Tests: We require all code to have at least unit test coverage.
2. Green CI Tests: We use Github Actions to test all pull requests. We require that the tests pass before the pull request is merged.

# Code Review Process

Code review takes place in GitHub pull requests. See [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) if you're not familiar with GitHub Pull Requests.

Once you open a pull request, project maintainers will review your code and respond to your pull request with any feedback they might have. The process at this point is as follows:

1. Two thumbs-up are required from project maintainers
2. Your change will be merged into the project's master branch

## How to report a bug

Any security issues should be submitted directly to [security@high-mobility.com](mailto:security@high-mobility.com). In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions is "yes" then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at [security@high-mobility.com](mailto:security@high-mobility.com).

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

* What version of the library are you using?
* What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
* What did you do?
* What did you expect to see?
* What did you see instead?

General questions should go to [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/high-mobility) instead of the issue tracker.
